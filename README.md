# Yahtzee by Owen Eugenio & Paul Gigilo
- Yahtzee created in java using the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) design pattern.
- Yahtzee's rules are pretty universal and standardized, but [we used Hasbro's rules](https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/yahtzee.pdf)


# What makes our game special?
Our game is special because:
- It is created using the MVC design pattern which was a real challenge, but it allows for more modularity when programming.
- Implemented fancy sounds (all royalty free!) and reactive application
- Clickable gameplay
    - Lock dice via clicking.
    - rolling and scoring via buttons.
- Fully scalable and resizable!
- Toggleable options via launcher!

# Why MVC over Traditional Object-Relational Design?
- Using MVC allowed us to more easily to seperated the buisness logic and the viewing logic.
  - This allowed us to have different aspects of our code seperated, making development more modular.
- MVC is common design pattern used in small application development, using this pattern gave us a glimpse at what development in the real world may look like.
